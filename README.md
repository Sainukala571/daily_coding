#DAY- LARGEST ELEMENT IN ARRAY
Problem Description

The task is to find the largest element in an array of integers.

You are given an array arr containing n elements.

Your goal is to check each element and determine which one is the maximum value.

Finally, return that largest element.

Approach Used

Start by assuming the first element of the array is the largest.

Loop through the remaining elements one by one.

Compare each element with the current largest value.

If the element is greater, update the largest value.

After the loop ends, the variable largest will hold the maximum element.
